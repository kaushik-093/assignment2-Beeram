## Paris

The **French** capital is one of the most **romantic** place in the Europe. With its abundance of **history**, there is so much to study and view in this city. There are so many different styles of **architecture**. It’s all so unique to Paris, and really makes the city so **unique** and **beautiful**. My favorite buildings include the **Cathédrale de Notre-Dame** and **the Hôtel Carnavalet**.
